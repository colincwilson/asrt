Research comprises "creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock
of knowledge, including knowledge of humans, culture and society, and the use of this stock of
knowledge to devise new applications."[1] It is used to establish or confirm facts, reaffirm the
results of previous work, solve new or existing problems, support theorems, or develop new
theories. A research project may also be an expansion on past work in the field. To test the validity
of instruments, procedures, or experiments, research may replicate elements of prior projects, or the
project as a whole. The primary purposes of basic research (as opposed to applied research) are
documentation, discovery, interpretation, or the research and development (R&D) of methods and
systems for the advancement of human knowledge. Approaches to research depend on
epistemologies, which vary considerably both within and between humanities and sciences. There
are several forms of research: scientific, humanities, artistic, economic, social, business, marketing,
practitioner research, etc.
